Docker version 1.13 onwards allows to autolock the swarm duing initialization as well as at a later stage. Docker swarm
can be autolocked to protect the raft logs for the manager nodes and TLS communication between swarm nodes.

#docker swarm init --autolock

(this command provides a key that should be used to unlock the swarm when a manager restarts)

#docker swarm update --autolock=true
(to set autolock at a later stage)

#docker swarm unlock
- Give the key 

Unlock of the swarm is only needed when docker is restarted on the manager node.
