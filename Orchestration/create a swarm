Create a docker swarm -

Docker swarm can be created from a master manager node. The node should have docker installed on it.

#docker swarm init 
(optional --advertise-addr <IP of the Master Manager node>)

Now you can add any number of nodes to the swarm either as other manager nodes, or as worker nodes. A swarm can have more than one manager.
Before a node can join the swarm as a manager or a worker, it needs a token from the master manager using below command -

#docker swarm join-token manager|worker

To add a manager to the swarm -
#docker swarm join --token <TOKEN for manager> <IP of the Master Manager Node> 

To add a worker node to the swarm -
#docker swarm join --token <TOKEN for worker> <IP of the Master Manager Node>

Check the swarm -
To list all the nodes in a swarm -
#docker node ls

To check the details on the swarm -
#docker info
