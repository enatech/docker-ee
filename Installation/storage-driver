Storage driver is where images as well as container's writable layer are stored on a host.

Common storage drivers

CentOS - devicemapper requires direct-lvm for prod as loopback-lvm has poor performance. CentOS 8 supports overlay2 now. devicemapper operates at block level.
RHEL - devicemapper and overlay2 - overlay2 is preferred, it operates at file level.
Ubuntu - aufs3 operates at file level.
Oracle Linux - devicemapper
vfs - is used for testing purpose as poor performance
zfs and btrfs - are used for backup filesystems, require lot of memory and require more maintenance and setup.

To check which driver being used -
#docker info | grep Storage

Storage drivers can be setup in /etc/docker/daemon.json

}
